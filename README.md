# 🚗 Sikh Car Detailing – Appointment Booking System (Wix)

## 📌 Overview  
This project was created for a local business, **Sikh Car Detailing**, to help clients easily book car detailing appointments online. Built on **Wix**, the site featured a responsive front-end interface, booking confirmation for users, and an integrated database using **Google Sheets and Excel** to help the business track services efficiently.

It was a real-world project developed for a client as part of a university course, showcasing skills in design, team collaboration, and project delivery.
